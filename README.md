This is the code for weather station based on Heltec32 wifi Lora V3 with SCD40(temperature,humidty,co2 sensor) and BMP280(pressure and temperature sensor). The problem is in I2C connection. The sensors does not work together but they work individually. They both have different addresses. The SCD40 0x61 and BMP280 0x76.
